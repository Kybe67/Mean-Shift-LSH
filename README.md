# Nearest Neighbours Mean Shift LSH

This algorithm was create during an internship at Laboratoire d'Informatique de Paris Nord with Lebbah Mustapha, Duong Tarn, Azzag Hanene and Beck GaÃ«l.
It's purpose is clustering of multivariate multidimensional dataset, especialy image.
Mean Shift strenght is automatic detection of cluster number and contrary to K-means it can detect non eliptical clusters.

### Usage
This algorithm is build to work with indexed dataset.

### Image analysis recommandation
In order to do image analysis it is recommand to convert data from RGB to Luv space adding space index.
